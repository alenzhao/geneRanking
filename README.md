# geneRanking

This is all the data and code to get the results in my paper, [Gene Ranking of RNA-Seq Data via Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137782).

See src directory for the code in detail.

DNMF is at [![CRAN Version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/DNMF)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DNMF) or [my github](https://github.com/zhilongjia/DNMF).
